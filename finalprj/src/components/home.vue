      The New 7 Wonders of the World campaign began in 2000 with the goal of
      selecting seven new Wonders of the World from a list of 200 current
      monuments. The New 7 Wonders Foundation (N7W) in Zurich, Switzerland,
      organized the popularity poll, which was chaired by Canadian-Swiss Bernard
      Weber and conducted by free Web-based voting and minor amounts of
      telephone voting, with winners announced on July 7, 2007 in Lisbon, at
      Est√°dio da Luz. Because it was feasible for participants to vote several
      times, the poll was deemed unscientific. New 7 Wonders Foundation
      conducted "the largest poll on record," according to John Zogby, founder
      and current President/CEO of Zogby International, a polling firm based in
      Utica, New York.
