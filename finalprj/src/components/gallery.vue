      In the year 2000, a Swiss organization began a search for the New Seven
      Wonders of the World. Given that the original Seven Wonders list was
      prepared in the 2nd century BCE, and that only one entrant (the Pyramids
      of Giza) is still standing, it seemed like a good time for a refresh. More
      than 100 million votes were made on the Internet or via text messaging,
      indicating that people all across the world agreed. The final results,
      published in 2007, were greeted with both applause and jeers, as a number
      of significant contenders, such as Athens' Acropolis, were unable to make
      the cut.

    <h2>The Great Wall of China</h2>
    <p>
      It's possible that great is an understatement. The Great Wall of China,
      one of the world's largest construction projects, is usually regarded to
      be roughly 5,500 miles (8,850 km) long; nevertheless, a disputed Chinese
      research states the length is 13,170 miles (21,200 km). The construction
      began in the 7th century BCE and lasted two millennia. The building,
      despite being labeled a "wall," really has two parallel walls for long
      periods. The barrier is also dotted with watchtowers and barracks. The
      wall's effectiveness, on the other hand, was not that great. Despite being
      erected to deter invasions and attacks, the wall failed to offer adequate
      security. Scholars have concluded that it was more of a form of "political
      propaganda."

    <h2>Chichén Itzá</h2>
    <p>
      Chichén Itzá is a Mayan metropolis in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula that
      thrived in the 9th and 10th century CE. A number of notable structures and
      temples were created by the Mayan tribe Itzá, who were heavily influenced
      by the Toltecs. The stepped pyramid El Castillo ("The Castle"), which
      rises 79 feet (24 meters) above the Main Plaza, is one of the most
      prominent. The construction has a total of 365 steps, which corresponds to
      the number of days in the solar year, and is a tribute to the Mayans'
      astronomical ability. The setting sun casts shadows on the pyramid during
      the spring and fall equinoxes, giving the illusion of a serpent sliding
      down the north stairs; at the foot is a stone snake head. However, life
      was not all work and science. The largest tlachtli (a type of sporting
      field) in the Americas is found in Chichén Itzá. On one field, the locals
      participated in a pre-Columbian Mesoamerican ritual ball game.

    <h2>Petra</h2>
    <p>
      Petra, Jordan's ancient city, is hidden among sandstone slopes and cliffs
      in a lonely valley. It was said to be one of the locations where Moses
      smote a rock, causing water to gushe forth. Later, the Nabataeans, an Arab
      tribe, established it as their capital, and it flourished during this
      period, becoming a major commerce center, particularly for spices. The
      Nabataeans were skilled carvers who carved buildings, temples, and tombs
      into the sandstone, which changed color with the changing light. They also
      built a water system that enabled them to grow lush gardens and farm.
      Petra had a population of 30,000 people at its peak. However, as trade
      routes altered, the city began to deteriorate.A large earthquake in 363 CE
      added to the difficulties, and Petra was progressively abandoned following
      another seismic in 551. Although it was uncovered in 1912, archaeologists
      mostly ignored it until the late twentieth century, and many doubts
      regarding the city persist.

    <h2>Machu Picchu</h2>
    <p>
      Hiram Bingham "found" an Incan site in Cuzco, Peru, in 1911, believing it
      to be Vilcabamba, a hidden Incan fortress utilized during the 16th-century
      rebellion against Spanish control. Despite the fact that this allegation
      was ultimately debunked, the function of Machu Picchu has perplexed
      researchers. It was thought by Bingham to be the abode of the "Virgins of
      the Sun," women who lived in convents and took a chastity vow. Others say
      it was a royal retreat, while others believe it was a pilgrimage site. (It
      should not, however, be the location of a beer advertisement; in 2000, a
      crane used for such an ad toppled and damaged a monument.)Machu Picchu is
      one of the few great pre-Columbian ruins that have been discovered
      completely intact. Agricultural terraces, plazas, residential areas, and
      temples abound despite its remote location high in the Andes Mountains.

    <h2>Christ the Redeemer</h2>
    <p>
      In Rio de Janeiro, Christ the Redeemer, a massive statue of Jesus, rests
      atop Mount Corcovado. It was proposed by Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos
      Oswald, and Paul Landowski shortly after World War I, when some Brazilians
      feared a "flood of godlessness." Construction began in 1926 and took five
      years to complete. The monument's spread arms span 92 feet and it reaches
      98 feet (30 meters) tall (not including its base, which is around 26 feet
      (8 meters) tall (28 meters). It is the world's largest Art Deco
      sculpture.Christ the Redeemer is a reinforced concrete structure with
      nearly six million tiles covering it. The statue has been struck by
      lightning several times, and in 2014, the tip of Jesus' right thumb was
      destroyed during a storm.

    <h2>Colosseum</h2>
    <p>
      Emperor Vespasian ordered the construction of the Colosseum in Rome in the
      first century. The amphitheater, which measures 620 by 513 feet (189 by
      156 meters) and has a complicated system of vaults, is a triumph of
      engineering. It could accommodate 50,000 spectators who came to enjoy a
      variety of events. Gladiator battles were perhaps the most famous, but men
      battling animals was also widespread. Water was even pumped into the
      Colosseum on occasion to simulate naval battles. The assumption that
      Christians were martyred there—specifically, by being thrown to lions—is,
      however, debatable. Around 500,000 individuals are thought to have died in
      the Colosseum, according to some estimations. Furthermore, so many animals
      were trapped and then slain there that several species are said to have
      gone extinct.

    <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>
    <p>
      This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is considered one of the world's
      most iconic structures and is considered to be the best example of Mughal
      architecture. Emperor Shah Jahn (reigned 1628–58) erected it to
      commemorate his wife Mumtz Maal ("Chosen One of the Palace"), who died in
      1631 while giving birth to their 14th child. The project, which includes
      an enormous park with a reflecting pool, took 22 years and 20,000
      employees to build. The white marble mausoleum is adorned with
      semiprecious stones in geometric and floral motifs. Four smaller domes
      surround the spectacular central dome. According to certain accounts, Shah
      Jahan desired to have his own black marble mausoleum.However, he was
      deposed by one of his sons before any work began.
